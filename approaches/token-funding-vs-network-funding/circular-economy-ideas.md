# Circular economy ideas

There are a number of software projects that could benefit from trying to create a circular economy through the usage of a token. However most of these ideas could also be implemented by using the networks treasury funding to sustain long term development. This means a token based funding approach would not be necessary.



**Software ideas**

The following ideas could create a circular economy with their own token, they could also charge fees to become self sufficient using the network coin and finally they could also be funded by the networks own funding process.

* Stablecoin's - e.g. USD token
* Security tokens - e.g. Bonds, stocks
* Real world asset tokens - e.g. Tokens that represent commodities or a house, car etc.
* Soulbound tokens - Tokens that are issued and designated to a single individual or entity and are not transferable.
* Privacy tokens - A token could wrap an existing coin from a public chain and then make the transactions private.
* DeFi protocols - DEX, borrowing & lending, synthetics, derivatives, CDPs
* DAO, governance & identity tooling
* Utility software libraries - For building smart contracts, transaction builders etc
* Network infrastructure tools & libraries
* Security reviews & code audits
* Scalability solutions
* Indexers, explorers & data oracles
* Wallets



**Other non software ideas**

There are a number of non software ideas that could benefit from the networks treasury funding. These are commonly less suitable for being funded with the creation of a new token.

* Research & analysis
* Demos & onboarding
* Articles & blog posts
* Hackathons
* Contributor mentorship
* Community hubs
* Workshops & courses
* Ecosystem educational resources
* Translation support
* Standardisation efforts



**Reasons a token might be useful or necessary**

* **Token utility** - Ideas might need a token for unique use cases and functionality that they can't achieve with the networks own coin.
* **Customisation of token** - Tokens can be customised for different use cases such as how the supply changes over time, what parts of the token are immutable or mutable or how that token can be used in different applications and environments.
* **Token autonomy** - Having a separate token means the project team and surrounding community that use that token would have full autonomy to update and replace the token as needed for their projects specific use cases.
